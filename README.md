# full-stack-launcher

This is a project ready for launch: developing nodejs in the backend {{express}} and for the frontend {{react}}.
It is based on Ironlauncher https://www.npmjs.com/package/ironlauncher and https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html.

How to Install

1 - Clone the repo;

2 - Inside the full-stack-launcher folder run command "npm run firstInstall";

3 - Now you can just do "npm run dev" and both the backend and the frontend with "React" will run concurrently.

4 - You can test on your browser both http://localhost:5000/ for the backend and http://localhost:3000 for the frontend.

4 (optional) - If you want to check if the backend is communicating with the database and frontend just run "node backend/seeds/user.seed.js" and you will see random users has been filled on your http://localhost:3000/users route.
